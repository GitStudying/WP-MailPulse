# WP MailPulse

This Wordpress plugin automatically sends a scheduled test email with custom interval to an email address of your choosing to verify that outbound email setup works correctly. So, as a webmaster, you could set it to send you an email to your personal address: if you don't get a daily email - there's a problem.

The plugin sets up a configuration screen at Tools > WP-MailPulse - Email tester:

Setting the email address to which test emails will be sent on a custom schedule.
Triggering a test email manually, which is useful when initially setting up the plugin
If the debug.log is activated, the plugin will write a entry to it when it runs.

The plugin was created by GitStudying
